General:

Updated Lobby home screen to display a welcome message.
Fixed many white balance settings and particle colors to reduce the blowout of white. Should be easier on the eyes now.
Updated faction selection UI.
Fixed missing Crow model.
Temporarily removing Pounce from the Hellcat attack repertoire.
Crafting:

Additional changes made to Two Handed Weapon recipes, specifically the Great Hilt recipe. Removed Accoutrement recipe and removed it as a component to the Great Hilt recipe. 
Fixed the issue of not being able to Experiment on Focus Orb Shell crafting recipe. 
Disciplines:

Blood Pact: Reduced the Health conversion for Pips from 1000/1 to 250/1
Changed Bard song SFX timing so that the SFX is only played on initial application and not on each refresh.
Classes:

Fixed a bug where main tray power resource overrides would affect all powers instead of just main tray powers.
Druid:

Druids can no longer load out healing disciplines while in the Death tray and can no longer load out damage disciplines while in the Life tray (This was reported as a bug in the previous update by many players).
Known Issues:

Durability in crafted items is not properly carrying up the crafting chain.
Non Ranger classes lack bow animations. All bow related disciplines will remain inactive until they do.
Bard Speed Song cancels when entering combat.
Bard Speed Song remains at combat buff amounts if the buff was placed on you and you were in combat mode then went into non combat movement speed (waiting on race/class split to fix this one).
Vessel inventory objects can not be used at a Temple.
Weapon disciplines that grant weapon equips will not be fully functional until animations are added. 
Power adjustments have been made but updates to tooltips are still in process. Text descriptions may not completely coincide with their current functionality.
Character Carousel has been disabled from the front end menu for now.
Sizing and rotation on harvesting tools during harvesting animations are incorrect. 
UI bug: Sometimes when a player logs in the Chicken Ticker (Hunger Meter) below the health bar appears incorrectly. 
Power Cost Multiplier issues with dual wield weapons may still be occurring. Currently investigating and working on improvements.
